This is a simple simulator of Airplane purchase/sell system in a console. It was a task given by my mentor - the list of planes is taken from an xlsx file which contains multiple passenger planes as well as cargo planes. The trick in this task was NOT to use any streams, collections or methods such as System.arraycopy(), Arrays.copyOf(), Arrays.sort(), etc.
Additionally I could ONLY work on arrays, so I couldn't convert them to ArrayList at any point.

Options I implemented:

1. Purchase a new plane.
2. Sell a plane.
3. List all the planes in your hangar.
4. Sort planes by flight range.
5. Calculate overall passenger capacity across all of your passenger planes.
6. Calculate overall cargo capacity across all of your cargo planes.
7. Search for a plane.
8. Get the overall number of planes in the hangar.
9. Exit the app.
